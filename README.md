__TwoSnake Game__
===



A remake and modification of the __Snake Game__ with Pygame + Python! The game has better graphics, but yet, is not so GOOD. 

Myself even drew all sprites in photoshop manually (with mouse!). And I confess to all of you, I'm no talent in the art of drawing â€” unfortunately. The key central of this game is the idea to play with two players local a Snake Game! I (think) this very fun. I'm fight with my friends. Local game is very funs... it's nostalgic.

**NOTE: This software is alpha yet and your focus is the learning to control datas on logic games.**

This game was write previously in python3 on Windows. But i have add other file to suport python2 + pygame on Linux, a dumb solution for that (in future i fix that correctly). 

You do <b>need</b> of:
  * [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 

<b>Remind:</b> The res folder has to be on the same folder as the *.exe , otherwise, it will give you a segmentation fault, or you can change the path to the images and fonts in the main.cpp and recompile the game. If you are having problems executing the game is probably because you don't have the runtime libraries of the SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, so just look at the links above and download them.

<b>Roadmap:</b> 
  - [ ] When the some snake death: not restart game, but reboot that instance only (most important currently).

  - [ ] Generate random food with __perfect__ prevision to not generate below at any snake on the board.
  - [X] Sprites player with two colors diffs: head, body, turn and tail.
  - [X] A system with highscore and parser to verify and save on the exits of game the most highscore you won with that execution.
  - [x] Musics and other sounds interactives.
