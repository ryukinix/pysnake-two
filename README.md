__TwoSnake Game__
===



A remake and modification of the __Snake Game__ with Pygame + Python! The game has better graphics, but yet, is not so GOOD. 

Myself even drew all sprites in photoshop manually (with mouse!). And I confess to all of you, I'm no talent in the art of drawing â€” unfortunately. The key central of this game is the idea to play with two players local a Snake Game! I (think) this very fun. I'm fight with my friends. Local game is very funs... it's nostalgic.

**NOTE: This software is alpha yet and your focus is the learning to control datas on logic games.**

This game was write previously in python3 on Windows. But i have add other file to suport python2 + pygame on Linux, a dumb solution for that (in future i fix that correctly). 

You do <b>need</b> of:
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
  
 

<b>Remind:</b> In linux, the standard python version for pygame is python 2.x, then use the version *_2.py if have problens with this!

<b>Roadmap:</b> 
  - [ ] When the some snake death: not restart game, but reboot that instance only (most important currently).
  - [ ] Background sprite and textures.
  - [ ] Generate random food with __perfect__ prevision to not generate below at any snake on the board.
  - [X] Sprites player with two colors diffs: head, body, turn and tail.
  - [X] A system with highscore and parser to verify and save on the exits of game the most highscore you won with that execution.
  - [x] Musics and other sounds interactives.
  - [X] Pause game
